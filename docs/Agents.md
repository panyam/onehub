## Agent001 - Agents on OneHub

We have significant number of components for enabling topics, messaging, graphs, nodes, edges and concurrency primitives for use in a generic way.  This paves the way for creating Agents that are custom, self-declaring in intent while removing the hassle of inter agent communication away from them.  So agents only have to focus on one thing and do the one thing well.

If this works well a success metric is we are able to implement any agentic "flow" (eg Reflexion, ReAct, CoT etc) using the agent1 platform (Agents on OneHub).
